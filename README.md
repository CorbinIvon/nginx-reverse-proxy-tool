# nginx-reverse-proxy-tool
A tool that makes passing services from localhost painless!

## Required
- nginx
- [charmbracelet/gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) [Optional]
- root privileges

This tool will quickly create a http reverse proxy server. The script will run you through everything you need to do to get your proxy up and running. Installing gum makes it a little quicker to toggle things. ðŸ™‚

## Usage
Run the script as root. root is usually needed to write to the /etc/nginx directory.

Currently supports the following services:
- [x] HTTP - Simple, non SSL service
- [ ] HTTPS - SSL service. Not yet implemented. Will use certbot and set file paths for the SSL certificates.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the script as root
